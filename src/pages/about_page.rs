                <p>"Over the past few years, we at Spiral Technology have explored various ways to harness the potential of Augmented Reality (AR), especially focusing on mobile platforms. The specific cases we've tested could constitute their own detailed stories, but currently, our emphasis is on Non-Destructive Testing (NDT). While each industry has its unique language and processes, ultimately, they're all aiming for the same goal: ensuring quality through detailed inspection."</p>
